#+TITLE: README for Pinentry-Rofi

* Description
  Based on [[https://gist.github.com/sardemff7/759cbf956bea20d382a6128c641d2746][this gist]]

  Simple pinentry gui using rofi written in GNU guile.

  It's similar in functionality as the gist but this one doesn't force
  the width to be 27 and doesn't depend on systemd.

  I also wanted a small project which I could use to practice writing
  GNU guile.

* 2.0.0 Breaking changes please read

  As of version 2.0.0, =pinentry-rofi= is now built using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/automake][automake]].
  See [[file:HACKING][HACKING]] for more info on that. It also lost its =-guile= prefix
  for the executable. And it is no longer just one file, most of its
  content is now a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/General-Information-about-Modules.html][guile module]], which the executable now calls.
