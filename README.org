#+TITLE: README for Pinentry-Rofi

* Description
  Based on [[https://gist.github.com/sardemff7/759cbf956bea20d382a6128c641d2746][this gist]]

  Simple pinentry gui using rofi written in GNU guile.

  It's similar in functionality as the gist but this one doesn't force
  the width to be 27 and doesn't depend on systemd.

  I also wanted a small project which I could use to practice writing
  GNU guile.

* Install
** From Source

  See [[file:HACKING][HACKING]] on how to build this from source
